<img src="Pictures/content-1.png" align="left" width="25" style="margin-right: 20px;" />
A sand box, non voxel, highly modifiable game with slightly smooth interconnected blocks rather than traditional blocks. It is coded 100% in java (openGL lwjgl and jme).

---

### What's special?

#### Semi-smooth node meshes
blocks are connect with rounded transitions rather than hard cube edges
#### [JavaScript modifier system](https://github.com/OxillenGlow/MtSharpGrain/wiki/2.1-Code) 
Full powerful modding system to allow for JavaScript modding via GraalJS

You can control everything from player location to making new things floating around.
 
Why mods?
- I am a single person and do not have the resources to make a full game.
- I will **not** be able to make my game fit everyone's taste.

Modding solves both as **anyone including you!** can make *their own mini game* on top without messing with boring parts. This is more true with AI.

Like the idea? **[download now](https://github.com/OxillenGlow/MtSharpGrain/releases)** And go [here](https://github.com/OxillenGlow/MtSharpGrain/wiki/2.1-Code) to learn more on the modding system.

##### Proceduraly generated world

The world is generated on the fly based on a seed. (soon to be implemented: selecting a seed to make a new world)

Like with mods, you can edit the way worlds are made. See [wiki on this](https://github.com/OxillenGlow/MtSharpGrain/wiki/WorldGeneration)

##### Console command system

<sup>`!place` / `!destroy` commands. In progress...

### Special points
<img src="Pictures/content-1.png" align="left" width="25" style="margin-right: 20px;" />
This is a project aimed at making a futuristic grided sanbox game using shaders, enviroment, and interconnected nodes. Of course, the current version falls short by a lot.

### Important? stuff
#### What am i working on now?

> [!IMPORTANT]
> I am a bit tired already so i am going to make a publishable beta release before I finish the rest here.
>
> The biggest problem is to make the NPC stuff work with mods which will likely be 10x harder than the completed refactoring of mods. Im just going to make a tiny java class for a independent NPC mini system.

My todo/doing list:

```
map
  root((To Do List))
    Rendering & Graphics
      Shadow renderer bug (likely jMonkeyEngine issue)
      Graphics toggle options
        View distance
        Shadows
      Increase render distance
      Fix window transparency bug
      Fix chunks zipping around bug
    GUI
      GUI Upgrade - Ongoing
      
    Core Systems
      World selection UI - 0%
        Split Main.java before and after world creation
        Implement super simple gui for selection - 0%
        Current world selection is done with arguments on starting the app but really, no one will use that.
      Physics System - 0%
        Implement as Java module
        Fix collision system
        Add fall damage mod
      Multiplayer Mod Support - 0%
        Real multiplayer (later phase)
    Content Generation
      Randomly Spawned Buildings
        Ground buildings - 0/100
        Air buildings - 1/100
        **Help wanted**: Add building, variations email me if you are a good world builder and want to help!
      NPC System - 70%
        NPC spawning fixes 100%
        NPC behavior system - 20%
        NPC control scripts
        NPC lagging 0%
    Bug Fixes & Refactoring
      Performance Optimization
        Reduce blocks drawn
      Remove the "Update" flag stuff in JS for new, working, java timed update.
```

<sup>80% here means it is basically done but could be improved</sup>

Done:

 - Java Timed Update API, Alternative to blocking setInterval 80%
 - Mod blocks with a Matrix API 70%
 - remove mod thread from main thread. 90% ?(This is a **big** refactoring and because I am bad at this stuff, I gave the work to replit agent, hopefully, it did its job well but idk commit: [328a...](https://github.com/OxillenGlow/MtSharpGrain/commit/328a0d94e4593c1bdab88822d84c2999c514918f) and [575e...](https://github.com/OxillenGlow/MtSharpGrain/commit/575e299de24305037bb86f87c4f3d860c8318754)) 90%
 - Added space skybox 90% - i need to refine skybox
 - Used the java zip tool to allow for compressing chunks to much smaller sizes 80%
 - Extend JS API further
     - Simple save data api with XML 90%
     - Intermod communication API 100%
     - Utility constant display support for prefixing mods with:
         - LFT
         - RHT
         - BTM
         - to constantly display gui on left, right bottom of screen. 60%
 - JavaScript, to add some real and powerfull scripting (thanks a lot to claude)100%

- **And much more who has made coding this easier for me and free**

#### AI?

Yes, I use claude a lot, perhaps too much? idk just speeds things up and removes need for constantly checking the API of whatever thing is implemented. Also, to be honest, Claude write code with less bugs and faster than me.

This is only for code, all assets/ideas are human made (not that i use a lot of assets).
